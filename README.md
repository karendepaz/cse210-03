# Jumper

# Jumper is a game a lot like Hangman. You must guess the letters in
# a word before the Jumper runs out a parachute.

# The rules are as follows:
# - The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list.
# - The player guesses a letter in the puzzle.
# - If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
# - If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute.
# - If the puzzle is solved the game is over.
# - If the player has no more parachute the game is over.

# The game specifications are as follows:
# - The program must include a README file.
# - The program must include class and method comments.
# - The program must have at least four classes.
# - The program must remain true to game play described in the overview.

# Open the '__main__.py' file and run it to start the game.
